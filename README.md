<p> During lab 6, the task was to write a sketch with two different sprites. One acting as the avatar and one acting as an item or target. The goal is for the avatar to obtain the target. The target must spawn randomly across the canvas. When your avatar achieves the task of obtaining the target, the avatar should animate in some way. You then would make the target dissapear when the avatar gets it. Lastly, you are supposed to make your target spawn the item 5 times randomly until the character gets them all.
  
<p> To complete the tasks within lab 6, I used the p5.js software and used a 400 by 400 sketch. I chose a monkey for my avatar meaning I created a function called "addMonkey" and used ellipses to create a monkey. I then chose a pellet of monkey food to be my target. This called for the creation of another function coincidenlty named "addMonkeyFood". I created X,Y, and Diameter variable for both the food and the monkey. The X and Y were intialized with random variables for the food and monkey. By creating these variables it allowed me to create a keyPressed() function in which the monkey would move when the arrow keys were pressed. Lastly I used a distance formula with if-else statements to allow the food to dissapear when the target got close enough and for the monkey to animate by changing colors.
